            <h4> A bit about me:</h4>
            <p>
                I live in sunny Salt Lake city, UT with my wife, Audrey, and pet husky. For the past 3 years I've
                developed games
                and studied while working at a variety of call centers.
                These terrible customer experiences, and a lifetime full of hatred from competitive gaming, drove me to
                wantr to
                create the most brutal, painful, and challenging video games I could imagine to make other suffer as I
                have.
                Of course my creative counterpart, Audrey, despises difficult video games which allows for reasonable
                compromise
                in their design. I truly believe if it wasn't for her nobody would be able to stand any of the things
                I've made or
                done so far.
                I always found the best challenges are overcome with critical thinking so I've made it a personal
                philosophy of
                mine to make any challenge in the games I make a mental one first and an ability challenge second. I
                feel this
                also makes the games and puzzles I design more accessible as well.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>

                Of course, there is a lot more to what I do than just creating video games. I enjoy problem solving and
                buildin
                which is what drove me to also learn to create websites such as the one you are on now.
                I have a knack for getting things to work eventually. Whether it is a puzzle, game, or error message,
                with enough
                time and patience I am able to snake my way through it and get it done.
                This talent is something I am proud of and I make good use of it in my daily life in the form of solving
                household
                issues to finding issues with the way we do things at my place of work.
                I would almost describe it as a kind of productive laziness where my mind wants to solve as many
                problems as
                possible using the least amount of brain power or effort.
