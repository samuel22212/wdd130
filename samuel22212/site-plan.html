       <h4> Hello! My name is Samuel, Welcome to my website!</h4>
      <p>
        Below is a list of some of my favorite projects I was able to be a part of along with a few reasons I was happy to work on them. My hope is that by seeing some of the things 
        I was able to work on before, you would be able to better see if I would be a good fit for your current projects or games. Some of my most notable works include such hits as: Dork - The text adventure, You Can Never - Make This Jump or YCN-MTG for short, Rainy Day Over, and Flop 3D. 
        I also worked on some mods for Minecraft such as Deathblok and Voidcraft which can be found on curseforge. Creating is an amazing thing and something that I have loved doing for a long time now. I hope I can create things that people will enjoy for years to come.

      <h3>About Myself</h3>
      <p>
        I live in sunny Salt Lake city, UT with my wife, Audrey, and pet husky. For the past 3 years I've developed games and studied while working at a variety of call centers. 
        These terrible customer experiences, and a lifetime full of hatred from competitive gaming, drove me to wantr to create the most brutal, painful, and challenging video games I could imagine to make other suffer as I have. 
        Of course my creative counterpart, Audrey, despises difficult video games which allows for reasonable compromise in their design. I truly believe if it wasn't for her nobody would be able to stand any of the things I've made or done so far.
        I always found the best challenges are overcome with critical thinking so I've made it a personal philosophy of mine to make any challenge in the games I make a mental one first and an ability challenge second. I feel this also makes the games and puzzles I design more accessible as well.

      </p>
        <P>
        Of course, there is a lot more to what I do than just creating video games. I enjoy problem solving and buildin which is what drove me to also learn to create websites such as the one you are on now.
        I have a knack for getting things to work eventually. Whether it is a puzzle, game, or error message, with enough time and patience I am able to snake my way through it and get it done. 
        This talent is something I am proud of and I make good use of it in my daily life in the form of solving household issues to finding issues with the way we do things at my place of work. 
        I would almost describe it as a kind of productive laziness where my mind wants to solve as many problems as possible using the least amount of brain power or effort. 

        I love meeting and working with people. If you have any questions or want to reach out to me about a project please use my business email samuelporter219@gmail.com

      <h3>Upcoming projects</h3>
      <h4> I am writing a book!</h4>
      <p>
        The World Wanderer is a high fantasy adventure book based off of a Fantasty role playing game my friends and I invented when we were younger. 
        The book is about a group of legendary heroes who have retired after saving the world from an evil tyrant. The problem is that while overthrowing the despotic ruler was a simple enough task, solving the socioeconomic challenges presented in his absence are much too difficult for the group of adventurers.
        In fact, these challenges prove so difficult that they find it easier to simply create a new world from scratch and start over. The book serves as both an exciting fantasy adventure in a new land
        and also serves as a subtle commentary on the difficult nature of ruling over a group of people and the different problems presented by different types of government.
        The book also explores themes of self discovery as our central protaganist; a boy by the name of Isabel, is trying to better understand their identity and purpose in the new world that they recently helped create. 
        To me the World Wanderer is meant to pose a question to the knights and dragons stories I grew up with. Questions such as "What did the knight do after he saved the princess?" and "What does happily ever after really mean?"
        
        The World Wanderer is expected to hit bookstores near you winter 2026!
