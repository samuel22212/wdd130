        <h4> Hello! My name is Samuel, Welcome to my website!</h4>
        <p>
            Below is a list of some of my favorite projects I was able to be a part of along with a few reasons I was
            happy to work on them. My hope is that by seeing some of the things
            I was able to work on before, you would be able to better see if I would be a good fit for your current
            projects or games. Some of my most notable works include such hits as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Dork - The text adventure</li>
            <li>You Can Never - Make This Jump</li>
            <li>Rainy Day Over </li>
            <li> Flop 3D. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I also worked on some mods for Minecraft such as Deathblok and Voidcraft which can be found on curseforge.
            Creating is an amazing thing and something that I have loved doing for a long time now. I hope I can create
            things that people will enjoy for years to come.
