                    The World Wanderer is a high fantasy adventure book based off of a Fantasty role playing game my
                    friends and I
                    invented when we were younger.
                    The book is about a group of legendary heroes who have retired after saving the world from an evil
                    tyrant. The
                    problem is that while overthrowing the despotic ruler was a simple enough task, solving the
                    socioeconomic
                    challenges presented in his absence are much too difficult for the group of adventurers.
                    In fact, these challenges prove so difficult that they find it easier to simply create a new world
                    from scratch
                    and start over. The book serves as both an exciting fantasy adventure in a new land
                    and also serves as a subtle commentary on the difficult nature of ruling over a group of people and
                    the different
                    problems presented by different types of government.
                    The book also explores themes of self discovery as our central protaganist; a boy by the name of
                    Isabel, is trying
                    to better understand their identity and purpose in the new world that they recently helped create.
                    To me the World Wanderer is meant to pose a question to the knights and dragons stories I grew up
                    with. Questions
                    such as "What did the knight do after he saved the princess?" and "What does happily ever after
                    really mean?"

                    The World Wanderer is expected to hit bookstores near you winter 2026!
