        <p> Hello! My name is Samuel Porter but you can call me Sam. The most important thing to know about me is that I am married to the love my life, Audrey, who is
            perhaps the most wonderful person in the all of creation. I have been happily married for a little over a year and a half and I am ready to spend the rest of forever with her. 
            Our favorite things to do together are hiking, stargazing, watching tv, and long road trips to places we've never been. 
        </p>

            I am currently a student looking for a degree in applied technology from BYUI. I have had an interest in technology since I was very young and am excited that my dreams of understanding how my favorite webpages and sites work is finally coming true. 
            I am also nervous although I am sure that comes with the territory of learning a new language, markup or otherwise. 
            I am a proud member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and am happy to admit that I would not have been able to even make it this far if it wasn't for the guidance of the spriit and help from Heavenly Father to endure some harsh trials that nearly prevented me from enrolling. 

        </p>
        <p> I am excited to get to know my fellow classmates and hope that we can achieve great things together. </p>
